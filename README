3D DRAM based architecture for Deep Neural rNnetworks

 - the architecture includes a 3D-DRAM (e.g. DiRAM4), a manager layer and a PE array layer

Manager Layer
  - under 3DSystem/Manager
  - RTL WIP
  - Simulation - WIP

PE Array Layer
  - under 3DSystem/PEArray
  - RTL WIP
      * completed floating point operations for convolution
      * need to instantiate SIMD (currently convolution operations are passed directly back to the Manager 
  - Simulation
      * system verilog
      * SV checks mamory writes to PE local and upstream stack bus packets to ensure values and addresses are correct
        - focuses on floating point operations
      * To run PE Array simulation
        a) cd 3DSystem/PEArray/SIMULATION/sv
        b) source ../../setup.do
        c) ./compile.do compile.log
        d) grep ERROR transcript ; grep PASS transcript | wc -l
           - should be no ERROR's and a PASS count of 20480
