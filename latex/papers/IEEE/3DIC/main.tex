%\section{Introduction}
Machine Learning in the form of \acfp{ann} has gained traction over the last few years especially in applications such as image recognition and speech recognition.
These particular applications typically employ a subset of \acp{ann} known as \acp{cnn} which re-use parameters and thus reduce main memory bandwidth.
However, there are other types of \ac{ann} that do not provide reuse opportunities such as autoencoders \iffalse\cite{le2013building} \fi and \ac{lstm}\iffalse\cite{}\fi . \iffalse and implementations that focus on \ac{cnn}s suffer from severe performance degradation when targeting these other types of \acp{ann}. \fi
It is generally accepted that \ac{dram} is required to store the \ac{ann} parameters of useful sized \acp{ann}\iffalse \cite{azarkhish2017neurostream}\cite{dadiannao2014}\cite{dadiannao2017}\fi.
To achieve a given performance, \ac{cnn}-specific implementations utilize cache-like structures using \ac{sram} which mimimizes accesses to the slower \ac{dram}.
Most research has focused on implementing \acp{cnn} but because of their extensive use of \ac{sram} have both \ac{ann} size restrictions and performance degradation when used in applications that utilize other types of \ac{ann}.
This work considers embedded applications employing multiple disparate generic \acp{ann} which, assuming there are limited reuse opportunities in the form of re-use or batch processing, will require usable memory bandwidth on the order of tens of \textbf{\SI[per-mode=symbol]{}{\tera \bit \per \second}}. 
\iffalse
This work demonstrates how a customized \acf{3ddram} with a very wide databus can be combined with application-specific layers to produce a system meeting the requirements of embedded systems employing multiple instances of disparate \acfp{ann}.
\fi
\iffalse
This work avoids any dependencies on \ac{sram} that might limit the size or type of \acp{ann} and demonstrates the required utilization of the very wide \ac{dram} databus.
By employing instructions and data structures that facilitate operating directly out of the \ac{3ddram}, 
and allowing system functions to operate asynchronously, 
this work is able to absorb the latencies associated with \ac{dram} and utilize the wide databus of a customized \ac{dram} to provide the bandwidth required to support multiple useful-sized disparate \acp{ann}.
This work demonstrates a near-memory system that does not simply add \ac{ann} processing as an appendage to an existing \ac{3ddram} but proposes customizations to an existing \ac{3ddram} along with tight integration of the \ac{ann} processing elements and memory controller to 
create a true near-memory \ac{ann} accelerator.

%\section{Description}
This work provides support to \acp{dnn} that do not provide \ac{ann} parameter reuse \iffalse\cite{coates2013deep}\fi and suggests that these types of applications will require that all \ac{ann} parameters in main memory be accessed in real-time.
This work coins the phrase ``goldilocks bandwidth'' when applied to \ac{ann} systems where the system provides the bandwidth required to read all \ac{ann} parameters at a real-time rate\iffalse of \SI{16}{\milli\second}\fi. 
This work employs pure 3DIC technology along with a proposed custom 3D-\ac{dram} which exposes an entire page over a very wide databus (Fig \ref{fig:customDram}).
The 3DIC system die stack (Fig \ref{fig:3DICStack}) includes the 3D-\ac{dram}, a system manager layer and a \ac{pe} layer collectively known as a \ac{ssc} (Fig \ref{fig:SSC}).
The targeted 3D-\ac{dram}, the Tezzaron DiRAM4\cite{tezzaron:diram4} employs multiple memory array layers in conjunction with a control and IO layer and provides 64 separate vaults each providing \SI{1}{\giga\bit} of storage which along with the suggested customizations provides this work up to \SI[per-mode=symbol]{65}{\tera\bit\per\second}.

The Manager decodes custom variable length instructions that describe the various operations that need to be performed to process a group of \acp{an}. Each instruction (Fig \ref{fig:instruction}) includes multiple descriptors (Fig \ref{fig:descriptor}) to control \ac{pe} and memory access operations. The manager also contains blocks to perform the memory read and write accesses and inter-\ac{ssc} communication.
The \ac{pe} performs \ac{mac} operations on the vectors of inputs and weights along with the activation function simultaneously for each of a group of \acp{an}. The \ac{pe} contains a \ac{sfu} which provides additional functionality for operations such as softmax, pooling etc.. The logic layout has been designed to accommodate a \ac{simd} for future work.

With the customized 3D-\ac{dram} combined with custom instructions and operation descriptors this work demonstrates a conservative 3X power improvement and 6X area improvement over similar \ac{ann} systems along with the ability to keep pace with the \ac{dram} roadmap over the foreseeable future.
