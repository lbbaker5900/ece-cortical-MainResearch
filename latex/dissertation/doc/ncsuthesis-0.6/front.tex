This dissertation explores employing a customized \ac{3ddram} and a pure \ac{3dic} system in the acceleration of \acp{ann} for systems deployed in embedded applications.
\iffalse
Assuming \acs{ann}s fulfill their potential, it is this work's belief that these systems will employ \acs{ann}s for various functions, such as engine monitoring, anomaly detection, navigation etc. and that the various system functions are implemented with a set of disparate \acs{ann}s.
\fi
%The combination of an embedded system and multiple disparate \acp{ann} means systems that employ \ac{sram} will not be able to provide the neccessary performance in terms of power or capacity.
\iffalse
A further assumption is that these embedded systems do not have access to cloud servers.

Although \acp{ann} have been known of for many decades, it hasn't been until the last few years that they have demonstrated efficacy in applications such as image recognition and voice recognition.

\acp{an} take their inspiration from neuron behavior observed in the mammalian brain, although implementations are simplifications of what actually exists in the brain.
These simplifications range from attempts to emulate the actual spiking behavior of real neurons to \acp{an} that simply encode the spiking behavior in the form of a number or rate.

The \ac{ann}s that have demonstrated most efficacy are a family of neural networks that can be described as \acp{dnn}.
These \acp{dnn} are created by cascading layers of rate-based \acp{an} to form a large, layered \ac{ann} employing ten's of thousands or more of \acp{an}. 

Considering the storage required for the input and the \ac{ann} parameters, the storage requirements result in gigabytes of memory.
When these \acp{ann} are required to be solved in fractions of a second, the processing and memory bandwidth becomes prohibitive.
Unfortunately, to achieve a high performance, existing implementations rely on processing a batch of inputs, such as processing a batch of images or voice recordings which all use the same \ac{ann} or by employing a sub-family of \acp{dnn}, known as \acp{cnn}, which reuse portions of the \ac{ann} parameters.

These techniques allow these implementations to hold and reuse data in fast local \ac{sram}.
%With this work's target application, the assumption is there is little opportunity for batch processing or reuse therefore data must be drawn constantly from main memory, which generally is \ac{dram}.
The assumption is that embedded systems do not have batch processing opportunities or parameter reuse therefore data must be drawn constantly from main memory.

%The combination of an embedded system and multiple disparate \acp{ann} means systems that employ \ac{sram} will not be able to provide the neccessary performance in terms of power or capacity.
%One area of integrated circuit technology that has started to be employed in \ac{ann}s is \acp{3dic}.  \acp{3dic} have the potential to increase connectivity, and thus bandwidth, 
%and keep power dissipation within acceptable levels.
This work demonstrates how a customized \ac{3dic} \ac{dram} can be combined with application-specific layers to produce a system meeting the required level of performance in embedded systems with multiple instances of disparate \acp{ann}.
This work avoids any dependencies on \ac{sram} that might limit the size of supported \acp{ann} and thus is able to support embedded systems that employ \acp{ann} that do not exhibit the memory reuse characteristics that make \ac{sram}-based systems effective.
This work operates directly out of the \ac{3ddram} thus avoiding the limitations of those \ac{sram}-based systems. 
The customized \ac{3ddram} is combined with instructions and data structures that facilitate operating directly out of the \ac{dram}.
By allowing system functions to operate asynchronously this work is able to absorb the latencies associated with \ac{dram} and provide the bandwidth required to support multiple useful sized disparate \acp{ann}.

By eliminating the dependency on \ac{sram} and proposing customizations to an existing \ac{3ddram}, this system is able to implement most useful types of \acp{dnn} and provide a 10X power improvement and 20X area improvement over similar \ac{ann} systems.

\begin{biography}
The author was born in a the United Kingdom.  After high school he took a job in a local electronic engineering firm
under a vocational program.
While working on the manufacturing floor and seeing the white coated "engineers" being called down from upstairs to solve the "big" problems, he decided he wanted to wear one
of those white coats.
The journey to the "white coat" took him to Brighton Polytechnic, now Brighton University and a First Class Honours Degree in Electrical Engineering.
After working in the UK for a couple of years, he moved to the United States.
The journey included a family with a daughter and two sons.
The education continued with a Masters in Engineering from Villanova University and a Masters in Business Administration from North
Carolina State University.

With the family now being somewhat independent, he decided to make a career change that would hopefully include teaching.

That career change included enrolling in the Electrical Engineering PhD program at North
Carolina State University. This stage of the education journey has resulted in this dissertation.
