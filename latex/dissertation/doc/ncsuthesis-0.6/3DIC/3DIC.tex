\section{Three-Dimensional Integrated Circuits (3DICs)}
\label{sec:3dic}

Over the last couple of decades, the ever-shrinking world of \acp{ic} has enabled the introduction of devices for various uses such as personal computing and cell phones.
As \ac{ic} technology has shrunk, design complexity has grown to take advantage of the hundreds of millions of transistors available on a typical \ac{ic}.
These \acp{ic} have evolved from performing small functions to becoming systems on a chip.

At some point, an \ac{ic} has to interface with another function and often that communication involves the moving of data to and from memory and the increase in complexity often drives a need for higher memory data bandwidth. 
\acf{ic} complexity has been doubling approximately every two years but the external interfaces are restricted by physical limitations.
Within the \ac{soc}, the designer can take advantage of very wide interfaces -- often thousands of bits wide -- to increase bandwidth, but when data is moved to off-chip memory, the widest buses are usually hundreds of bits wide.
One way to avoid this limitation is to employ \acp{3dic} (see Figure \ref{fig:3DIC Die}). The advantages of \acp{3dic} are well understood. reducing the amount of off-chip communication increases bandwidth and reduces power. The power reduction comes from not having to drive the relatively
high capacitance inputs and outputs.

\subsection{Pros and Cons}
\label{sec:3dic benefits}

Taking advantage of \acp{3dic} means stacking die on top of one another and making connections directly between the die. These connections can be in the form of wire made at the edges of the die or using vias buried in the die itself.


Below is a summary the benefits of \acp{3dic} :
\begin{outline}
  \1 Reduced Power
    \2 Mainly from not having to drive external outputs and receiving external inputs
  \1 Increased Connectivity
    \2 Maintaining very wide buses through the \ac{soc} increases bandwidth
  \1 Ability to mix heterogeneous technology
    \2 Mixed Analog/Digital
    \2 Mixing memory technology and logic technology
  \1 Increased density and mitigation against the slowing of Moore's Law
    \2 Using the vertical domain to increase perceived transistor per square millimeter
  \1 Potentially lower costs by combining simpler die rather than building a large die
    \2 Yield benefits from combining higher yield die
  \1 Possibility of novel architectures \cite{Kim2016}
\end{outline}

Some disadvantages of \acp{3dic} are:
\begin{outline}
  \1 Reliability
  \1 Cost
    \2 Being a relatively new technology, it is still expensive 
    \2 \ac{tsv} technology is still unreliable
\end{outline}

There is still some reluctance to fully embrace \acp{3dic} but undoubtedly the various barriers will be broken down.
\iffalse
The ability to mix technology targeted toward \ac{dram} with \acs{cmos} is something of which this work takes advantage.

In \cite{itrs2015_interconn} there are four definitions of \ac{3dic} interconnects:

\begin{outline}
%\section{3D-Wafer level package \cite{itrs2015_interconn}}
%\label{sec:3D-Wafer level package}

  \1 3D-Wafer level package \cite{itrs2015_interconn}
    \2 In this case, different die are stacked and then connected using traditional bond bumps and/or bond wires at the periphery of the chips.
    \2 This technique provides better transistor density compared to traditional 2D-IC with improvements in interconnect density.

%\section{3D-Stacked SoC\ac{soc} \cite{itrs2015_interconn}}
%\label{sec:3D-Stacked \ac{soc}}
  \1 3D-Stacked \ac{soc} \cite{itrs2015_interconn}
    \2 In this case, different die are stacked and then connected using \acp{tsv}. The \acp{tsv} connect the dies to intermediate metal layers known as global metal layers. This allows the individual die to maintain a high level of functionality and thus is similar to connecting functional building blocks, meaning the individual die are likely to be significant functional pieces of \ac{ip}.
    \2 Using \acp{tsv} provides a medium level of interconnect

%\section{3D-Stack \ac{ic} \cite{itrs2015_interconn}}
%\label{sec:3D-Stack \ac{ic}}
  \1 3D-Stack \ac{ic} \cite{itrs2015_interconn}
    \2 In this case, different die are stacked and then connected using \acp{tsv}. The \acp{tsv} connect the dies to intermediate higher metal layers known as global metal layers. This infers the individual die are not large functioning pieces of \ac{ip}.
    \2 Using \acp{tsv} provides a high level of interconnect

%\section{3D-Integrated Circuit \cite{itrs2015_interconn}}
%\label{sec:3D-Integrated Circuit}
  \1 3D-Integrated Circuit \cite{itrs2015_interconn}
    \2 In this case there are not multiple dies. Instead, the additional silicon layers are deposited on top of each other with the final \ac{3dic} device having multiple layers of transistors
    \2 Local metal layers are used, which along with \acp{tsv} provides a very high level of interconnect
\end{outline}

A die stack with \acp{tsv} can be seen in \fref{fig:tsv}.

\subsection{Construction}
\label{sec:3dic construction}

There are other definitions on how the dies are bonded together:
\begin{outline}
  \1 Wafer-to-Wafer
    \2 Current \ac{esd} mitigation allows implementation of unbuffered \ac{io} signals
    \2 Potential low yield because of lack of knowledge regarding \ac{kgd}
  \1 Die-to-Wafer
    \2 Will need additional \ac{esd} mitigation support
    \2 Higher yield because of \ac{kgd}
  \1 Die-to-Die
    \2 Will need additional \ac{esd} mitigation support
    \2 Higher yield because of \ac{kgd}
\end{outline}

This work is targeting \ac{3dic} technology that supports 3D-Stacked \ac{soc} or 3D-Stack \ac{ic} with high levels of interconnect.
To avoid using large \ac{io} buffers for the \ac{tsv} interconnect, this work assumes that the \ac{3dic} technology supports unbuffered interconnects which would suggest wafer-to-wafer bonding.
\iffalse because of the existing \ac{esd} mitigation during wafer handling although it is anticipated that improved \ac{esd} mitigation will be introduced in future manufacturing steps. \fi

\subsection{Design Guidelines}
\label{sec:3dic Design Guidelines}

The technology roadmap in \cite{itrs2015_interconn} and the information in \cite{patti2014} suggest \SI{5}{\micro\meter} pitch \acp{tsv} is a reasonable design goal. 
The dimensions of these \acp{tsv} are of the same order of magnitude as high-level metal layers in a typical 28nm technology node so they are considered to have similar characteristics.
Also, at an operating frequency of \SI[per-mode=symbol]{500}{\mega \hertz}, these small \acp{tsv} are not considered to be transmission lines so no additional provisions are needed to route signals between die other than those imposed by the higher metal layers.
However, to provide opportunities for future signal integrity analysis and improvements, this work assumes the \acp{tsv} are arranged in a signal-ground-signal array providing a one-to-one ratio of signal \acp{tsv} to power/ground \ac{tsv}.
So when accounting for area associated with \acp{tsv}, the number of signal \acp{tsv} is doubled.

As a large amount of \acp{tsv} are employed, \ac{tsv} energy cannot be ignored.
Most of the energy dissipated in the \acp{tsv} is associated with the charging and discharging of the capacitance. 
For \acp{tsv} with \SI{2}{\micro\meter} radius on a \SI{5}{\micro\meter} pitch, \cite{Bamberg2017} suggests an average capacitance of \SI{4.2}{\femto\farad} \footnote{\cite{patti2014} suggests a lower capacitance}.

Assuming a supply voltage of \SI{1.0}{\volt}, the power associated with a \ac{tsv} is shown in \eqref{eq:Energy in a TSV}.
\vspace{-2mm}
\begin{alignat}{2} 
\label{eq:Energy in a TSV}
\text{Energy to charge a \ac{tsv},\hspace{4mm}} E_{tsv} &= \frac{1}{2} \cdot C_{tsv} \cdot V^2  = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \num{4.2e-15} \cdot 1.0 = \SI[per-mode=symbol]{2.1}{\femto \joule} \nonumber \\
\text{Power per \ac{tsv},\hspace{4mm} } P_{tsv} &= E_{tsv} \cdot \text{bit rate} \nonumber \\
\text{normalizing to a clock of \SI{1.0}{\giga\hertz}} & \nonumber \\
\text{Power per \ac{tsv} per \si{\hertz} } &= \SI[per-mode=symbol]{2.1}{\micro \watt \per \giga \bit\per\second \per \ac{tsv}}
\end{alignat}

The \ac{tsv} design guidelines used by this work are summarized in Table \ref{tab:TSV Design Characteristics}.
%Therefore, this work assumes \acp{tsv} with a \SI{5}{\micro\meter} pitch and a power dissipation of \SI[per-mode=symbol]{2.1}{\micro \watt \per \giga \bit\per\second \per \ac{tsv}}.
